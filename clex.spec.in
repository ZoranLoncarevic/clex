%description

CLEX is a file manager with a full-screen text-based
user interface. It displays directory contents including
file status details and provides features like command
history, filename insertion, or name completion in order
to help the user to construct commands to be executed by
the shell. CLEX is easily configurable and its features
are explained in the on-line help.
