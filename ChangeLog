* * * CLEX Revision History * * *

3.15   14-AUG-2006
   Problems fixed:
      - the tilde expansion in the internal cd (change
        directory) command did not work in CLEX 3.14,
        the problem has been corrected
      - the usage of the <del> key in the history panel
        has been corrected: press <del> to delete the
        character from the command line and press
        <esc> <del> to delete the entry from the panel
      - the situation when some external command crashes
        and leaves the non-blocking flag set on standard
        input is now properly handled
   New/improved functionality:
      - the locate file function was replaced by a more
        efficient panel filter mechanism. The filtering
        is available in several panel types (ctrl-F)
      - some key bindings has been redefined for
        compatibility reasons:
                                             old        new
           move cursor left to next word    ctrl-B --> alt-B
          move cursor right to next word    ctrl-W --> alt-F
                             delete word    ctrl-D --> alt-D
                         directory panel     alt-D --> alt-W
                          bookmark panel     alt-B --> alt-K
        delete until the end of the line    ctrl-Y -> ctrl-K
       complete from the command history    ctrl-K --> alt-P
                      main function menu    ctrl-G --> alt-M
            insert the full filename   <esc> <tab> -> ctrl-A
      - (for emacs users) ctrl-G has now the same meaning
        as ctrl-C (cancel)
      - user and group names longer than 8 characters were
        silently truncated in the file panel, such names
        are now displayed using the '>' mark
      - user (alt-U) and group (alt-G) information panels
        have been added
      - new panel (<esc> <tab>) that summarizes all
        completion and insertion functions has been added.
        Type of the completion can be specified using this
        panel
      - completion of commands from the history utilizes
        the same user interface as the name completion
      - changes made in the bookmark manager can be
        cancelled
      - the input line of the directory panel has no longer
        precedence over the panel contents. You can switch
        the focus (indicated by cursor bar's visibility)
        from the input line to the panel and back
      - it is no longer possible to execute commands
        directly from within the history panel. It was
        easy to make a mistake there and execute other
        command than intended (panel vs input line)
      - characters '!' and ':' are automatically quoted only
        if your shell is a C-shell
      - there is yet another new option in the directory
        compare panel
      - configuration parameter SHELLPROG:
        standard option -c <COMMAND> is appended
        automatically if it is not specified
      - configuration parameters CMD_Fn:
        command parameters $c and $S have been added
        (cursor position and selected files)
      - configuration parameters LAYOUTn:
        there are two new fields: $S and $P
        (alternative forms of file size and permissions)

3.14   03-NOV-2005
   New/improved functionality:
      - directories can be now bookmarked. Bookmarks are
        automatically saved to a file. Tools for managing
        bookmarks are provided in the bookmark panel
      - new configuration parameter KILOBYTE controls
        whether filesize is displayed in 1000 or 1024 bytes
        large units
      - minor code cleanup 

3.13   21-SEP-2005
   Problems fixed:
      - the filename completion routine did not handle
        correctly the special case when a directory and
        a command in the search path had the same name.
        Now both files appear in the completion list
   New/improved functionality:
      - the undo function (ctrl-Z) has been improved,
        several editing steps can be undone and the
        counterpart editing function redo has been added
          <esc> ctrl-Z = redo

3.12   14-JUN-2005
   Problems fixed:
      - users could not save their configuration. This bug
        was introduced in the previous release and is now
        fixed

3.11   17-MAY-2005
   Problems fixed:
      - the sort order of the directory names in the
        directory panel was not controlled by the
        configuration parameter COLLATE
   New/improved functionality:
      - the panel used for confirmation of the configuration
        changes has been merged into the configuration panel
      - new option has been added to the directory compare
        panel
      - if a file cannot be read during data comparison,
        files are marked as different (previously only
        an unreadability warning was given)
      - entries from the command history list can be now
        deleted with the <del> key
      - pattern history has been removed from the select
        files function as it was not really helpfull
      - configuration parameter SHOW HIDDEN has been
        cancelled
      - added support for shifted left and right arrow
        keys

3.10   11-OCT-2004
   Numbering scheme change: after 3.1.9 comes 3.10
   Problems fixed:
      - user account data could be incomplete on some
        systems due to improper initialization
      - user account data was not updated on systems that
        do not store this information in /etc/passwd
        (e.g. with NIS); the user account data cache now
        expires after 5 minutes. Re-reading of the user
        account data can be also forced with the <esc>
        key pressed before the re-read command ctrl-R
      - the number of selected files was not shown correctly
        after selecting the last file in the panel
      - improved portability: signal names are printed
        using strsignal() instead of sys_siglist[]
        (if strsignal() is supported)
      - improved portability: GNU make utility is no
        longer required to build CLEX, standard make
        is sufficient
   New/improved functionality:
      - directory compare function got its own panel which
        allows finer control over the compare function,
        press <esc> = to activate it.
      - locate file function ctrl-F has been enhanced, the
        whole filename is checked for the entered string,
        not only its beginning
      - new locate file function <esc> ctrl-F has been
        added, it checks if the filename matches the entered
        pattern

3.1.9   29-APR-2004
   Problems fixed:
      - name completion could not complete filenames
        starting with the '=' character 
      - attempt to resize the CLEX window (in X)
        caused an error when
          "Press <Enter> to continue"
        was displayed on the screen
   New/improved functionality:
      - simple 'cd' commands are processed internally,
        this means that you can write:
          cd /my/new/directory
        to change the working directory
      - configuration of the file panel layout has been
        revised:
        - new LAYOUT syntax is more flexible
        - three different file panel layouts can be stored
          in the configuration, you can switch between them
      - new configuration parameters allow better control
        over language dependent settings like date/time
        format:
          FMT_NUMBER, FMT_DATE, FMT_TIME, COLLATION
        these parameters replace LOCALE
      - obsolete configuration parameter WARN_CD
        has been removed
      - filename completion is able to deal with quoted
        filenames. Only backslash quoting \x is supported
      - handling of different formats of device major
        and minor numbers has been improved
      - source code has been revised to comply with the
        ISO C strict aliasing rules

3.1.8   03-MAR-2003
   Problems fixed:
      - configuration parameters C_PANEL_SIZE and
        D_PANEL_SIZE could not be set to AUTO if AUTO
        was not the default value
   New/improved functionality:
      - on-line help starts with the Table of Contents
      - command line options --admin, --help, --version
        are recognized
      - screen size (columns x lines) is displayed while
        the CLEX window in X Window System is being resized 
      - new editing command: ctrl-Z - undo last insert or
        delete operation
      - new editing command: ctrl-O - insert the target of
        a symbolic link into the command line
      - there are now two compare directories functions:
          - quick compare - compares file names and types
          - thorough compare - compares also the contents
                               of files (file data)
        keyboard shortcut <esc> = is cancelled to prevent
        ambiguity
      - both panels are re-read automatically before
        doing directory comparison
      - in the main menu there are now keyboard shortcuts
        in order to ensure that all file panel functions
        have a shortcut:
          ctrl-G + - select all files
          ctrl-G - - deselect all files
          ctrl-G Q - quick compare
          ctrl-G T - thorough compare
      - a patch that fixes compile problems in the cygwin
        environment was contributed

3.1.7   15-JAN-2003
   Problems fixed:
      - filename completion ignored broken symlinks
      - filename completion in the current directory used
        the file panel's data without refresh, now it scans
        the directory
      - ctrl-Z key was not recognized on systems which map
        it to KEY_SUSPEND
   New/improved functionality:
      - ctrl-Z (pressed while a command is being executed)
        suspends only the launched command, not the CLEX
        (this feature requires POSIX job control)
      - history panel displays a remark if a command failed
      - filename completion panel displays file types
      - filename completion recognizes the command
        substitution syntax `command`
      - configuration parameter DIRECTORIES was replaced by
        D_PANEL_SIZE with more meaningful semantics, two
        other parameters were renamed
          COMPLETIONS -> C_PANEL_SIZE
          HISTORY     -> H_PANEL_SIZE
        this release recognizes both names. Please save your
        configuration if CLEX starts with warnings
      - parameters C_PANEL_SIZE and D_PANEL_SIZE can be set
        to AUTO (size of one screen without scrolling). AUTO
        is also the new default value
      - directory panel does not split the list of directory
        names into two parts

   Problems fixed:
      - rm (remove) command warning (configuration parameter
        WARN_RM) worked unreliably in the history panel
   New/improved functionality:
      - to quit CLEX press <esc> Q, the redundant <esc> X
        has been abandoned
      - new function: <esc> V - print program version
      - function keys <F2> - <F12> and <tab> work also in
        the file locating mode
      - filename completion of the type
          name=/some/file
        is performed only if the 'name' is a single word
        consisting of letters, digits, and the underscore
        character '_'

3.1.5   01-JUN-2002
   Problems fixed:
      - command line in the history panel was missing when
        the history panel was entered from the main menu

        treated as errors and caused program exit, now
        only a warning is given
   New/improved functionality:

        configuration parameter HELPFILE should not be
        set unless you have a translated or otherwise
        customized help stored in an external file
      - there are three new keyboard shortcuts for changing
        directories:
          <esc> /  = root directory
          <esc> ~  = home directory
          <esc> .  = parent directory
      - sorting files by time or size is available in both
        ascending and descending orders
      - selected sort order is valid for both file panels
      - filename completion recognizes shell metacharacters
        = < > >> | || && &
      - CLEX uses LFS (Large File Support) if available, LFS
        allows access to files larger than 2GB

3.1.4   29-APR-2002
   New/improved functionality:
      - the file selection mark '*' is a part of the
        configurable file panel's layout. If you don't
        use the default, you should update your LAYOUT
        configuration parameter
      - navigation in the directory panel is easier, the
        most recently used directories are listed separately
